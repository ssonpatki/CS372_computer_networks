### Preliminaries (Complexities of Network & Internet)

- Network: 
    - A network is a system that connects computers or other devices, allowing them to communicate and share resources. It involves the use of a single transmission technology, which can include wired or wireless connections.

- Internet: 
    - The Internet is a global system of interconnected networks. It is a vast network of networks that are connected by routers. These networks are configured to communicate among a variety of network transmission technologies. The Internet is often described as a network of networks, highlighting its decentralized and interconnected nature
    
    - Millons of connected computing devices 
        - hosts = end systems
        - running network apps
    - Communication links
        - fiber, copper, radio, satellite
        - transmission rate = bandwidth
    - Packet switches: forward packets (chunks of data)
        - routers and switches

- Growth of the internet
    - Ethernet made local networking possible
    - TCP/IP made internetworking possible
    - Changes from centeralized to distributed computing
    - Incorporated featyres for reliability, robustness, and scalability
        - Reliability: ensure data won't be lost or corrupted 
        - Robustness: recovery from errors
        - Scalability: add more hosts/routers... without re-designing the whole system
    - Significant economic impacts

- Networking Standards
    - IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force)
        - The maintainer of the Networking RFCâ€™s
        - The Internet Engineering Task Force
        - The organization that produces documentations which lay out standards for the Internet
        - The unofficial authority on internet standards

    - RFC (Request for Comments)
        - A repository for comments
        - An online resource managed by the IETF
        - The place to find (and post) the adopted standards for networking
        - A major resource for students and researchers in networking

### Preliminaries Metrics (measurements)
- Speed (distance/time) is measured in electronic units:
    - K = 10^3, M = 10^6, G = 10^9
- Size in bits, Bytes is measured in binary units
    - Ki = 2^10, Mi = 2^20, Gi = 2^30
    - eg. given disc size of 200 GiB
        200 x 2^30 Bytes = 214,748,364,800 Bytes
                        = 1,717,986,918,400 bits
- Bytes and bits (abbreviations)
    - use lower-case b for bits
    - use lower-case B for Bytes
    - ex. 1 Mi**b** = 128 Ki**B**


### Overview of Networking

#### Protocols
Protocols define
* format and order of messages sent and received among network entities
* actions taken on message transmission and receipt

*In simple terms, a protocol allows network entities to talk to one another in a defined manner*

*Network protocols govern how data is transmitted, received, and processed in a computer network*

#### Network Structure

* Network Edge: hosts and applications; clients and servers
All our familiar devices that access the internet occupy the network edge. Network Edge also includes the website servers and cloud data centers.

* Network Core: interconnected routers; network of networks
Network Core is made up of many routers and switches

_**[Note]** Network Core and Network Edge are all connected by physical media_

* Physical Media: communication links
Physical Media includes copper wire, optical fiber, wireless, and more

#### The Network Edge

_**Network Service Models**_

*Client/Server Model*: Client host requests/receives services from a server that is "always on"

*Peer-to-Peer Model (P2P)*: Minimal (or no) use of dedicated servers


_**Network Edge Service Types**_

*Connection-oriented service*

[TCP SERVICE]

* TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): Internet's connection-oriented service
* handshake: prepare for transfer; set up "state" in two communicating hosts
* reliable, in-order, byte-stream data transfer: acknowledgements and retransmissions
* flow control: sender won't overwhelm receiver
* congestion control: senders "slow down sending rate" when network is congested

Applications that use TCP
* HTTP
* FTP (file transfer)
* Telnet (remote login)
* SMTP (email)

*Connectionless service*

[UDP SERVICE]

* UDP (User Data Protocol): Internet's connectionless service; "light-weight", fast
* no handshake
* "unreliable" (best effort) data transfer
* no flow control
* no congestion control

Applications that use UDP
* Streaming media
* DNS


### Circuit Switching and Packet Switching

*Q: How is data transferred through the network*
*A: Two main ways: (1) circuit switching and (2) packet-switching*

Definitions
* Circuit switching: dedicated circuit per call; telephone net (phased out)
* Packet-switching: data sent through net in discrete "chunks"/packets on shared media

[Note] Modern Internet almost exclusively uses packet switching


#### The Network Core: Circuit Switching

[Concept]
* A dedicated physical communication path, or circuit, is established between the communication devices for the duration of the communication session
* Once circuit is set up, the entire bandwidth of that circuit is reserved exclusively for the two communicating devices
* Thus, during the established connection, no other devices can use that portion of the network

[Essentially]
* Network resources (for example, bandwidth) are divided into pieces
* Pieces are allocated to calls/connections
* Resource pieve idle if not used by owning call (no sharing resources)
* Ways of dividing resources
    * Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)
    * Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)

[Pros]
* Guaranteed performance
* Reliable delivery
* Simple Mechanism
* Fast Transfers (once circuit is established)

[Cons]
* Resource underutilization
* Connection setup time is overhead
* Not scalable


#### The Network Core: Packet-Switching

[Concept]
* Data is divided iinto discrete chunks called packets
* Packets are transmitted independently through the network
    * They may take different paths to reach the destination
* At receiving end, packets are reassembled in the correct order to reconstruct the original data

*NOTE: Packet-switching allows for creation of virtual connectiosns (allowing multiple devices to access the network simultaneously)*

[Essentially]
* Data transmitted in small, independent pieces
    * Source divides outgoing messages into packets
        * *Packets consist of header and payload* 
    * Destination recovers original data
* Each packet travels independently
    * header: contains instructions to the network for how to handle packet
    * may follow different paths
    * can be retransmitted is lost

[Functions]
* **Routing**: determines source-destination route taken by packets
* **Forwarding**: move packets from router's input to appropriate router output
* Source host (edge): Packet construction (encode/package data at source)
* Routers (core): Packet transmission (send packet from source to destination)
* Destination (edge): Packet interpretation (unpack/decode data from packet at destination; acknowledge receipt)

[Pros]
* no resource underutilization
* no blocked connection problem
* no overhead due to connection setup
* easier recovery from failures

[Cons]
* no guaranteed performance
* packet header overhead
* experience delays

### Packet Switched vs Circuit Switched Network

*Q: Which switching technology gives better performance, and in which circumstances?*
*A: Use concepts of switching and multiplexing to find out*

#### Multiplexing

Definitions
* multiplexing: to combine or mix-together
* de-multiplexing: to seperate out again

**Circuit Multiplexing not good for Packet Switching Networks**

* Traditional internet traffic sources often exhibit bursty behavior, where data is not continuously transmitted but rather in termittent bursts
* "Burstiness" often results in an average rate that is much lower than the peak rate
* With either TDM or FDM, network capacity may be underutilized during lean periods, leading to inefficient use of resources

**Statistical Multiplexing**
*The way in which packet-switched networks share network resources*
* Multiple data streams share a communication channel based on their demand or need
* Allocates resources based on the varying demands of users
* By adapting to changing user demands, statistical multiplexing optimizes the use of avaliable bandwidth

**Circuit switching vs Packet switching**

*Utilization (average % of bandwidth used)*
* Circuit switching transmits at a constant rate
* Packet switching allows more users to use network (better utilization)

*Probability*
* *N* = the number of users; *p* = probability that a user is active
* Binomial Probability Distribution with parameters *N* and *p* = the probability distribution of the number of successes *X* in a sequence of *N* independent trials/experiments
* A trial/experiment, outcome is either "success" or "failure"; X = 1 if success and X = 0 if failure
* Example: with N = 3 users and p = 1/3, what is the change that only 1 user is active?

Prob[(A active && B, C not) || (B active && A, C not) || (C active && A, B not)] 
= Prob[(A active && B, C not)] +
Prob[(B active && A, C not)] + Prob[(C active && A, B not)]
= p(1 - p)(1 - p) + p(1 - p)(1 - p) + p(1 - p)(1 - p)
= 3p(1 - p)^2
= 3(1/3)(1 - 1/3)^2 = 4/9

* Suppose we have *N* users. So, the probability that only *k* users (out of *N* users) are active:

(N Choose k)(p^k)(1 - p)^(N-k)

*The network core*
* Packet switching is fine for data that is not time-critical
* When all (or most) users want to be active, can cause:
    * Excessive congestion (leads to packet delay and loss; "jitter")
    * Packet construction creates additional overhead
    * Protocols needed for reiable data transfer, congestion control
    * Bandwidth guarantees are needed for audio/video apps

### Network Structure and Performance

**Access Network**
* *Access networks are managed by Internet Service Providers*
* *Modems* connect end systems to edge routers via access network media
* The topology of the internet (the structure of the interconnection among the various pieces of the internet) is loosely hierarchical 
* Local Internet Service Providers (ISPs) occupy the lowest tier 
    * their networks are called *access networks* because they provide access to the internet


**Network Performance Metrics**

*Network Delay*
* one of the most important performance measures is the average delay required to deliver a packet from origin to destination
* **Transmission Delay**: the time it takes to push all the bits of a packet onto the communication link
    * Factors Influencing Transmission Delay:
        * Link Bandwidth: The capacity of the communication link, indicating how many bits can be transmitted per unit of time.
        * Packet Length: The total number of bits in the packet being transmitted.
    * Transmission Delay Formula: dTrans = Packet Length / Link Bandwidth
* **Propagation Delay**: the time it takes for a bit to travel from the sender to the receiver
    * Factors Influencing Propagation Delay:
        * Physical Distance: The length of the communication channel or the distance between the sender and receiver.
        * Propagation Speed: The speed at which signals travel through the medium.
    * Propogation Delay Formula: dProp = Distance / Propagation Speed
* **Queuing Delay**: Occurs when a packet arrives at a router and has to wait in a queue before it can be transmitted
    * Factors Influencing Queuing Delay: 
        * Result of congestion within the network
        * If the rate at which packets arrive at the queue exceeds the rate at which they can be transmitted, a queue forms. 
        * Queuing delay is the time a packet spends waiting in this queue before it can be transmitted onto the next link. 
        * Higher congestion levels or a higher number of bits in the queue relative to the link bandwidth result in longer queuing delays.
    * Queuing Delay Formula: dQueue = Number of bits in the queue / Link Bandwidth
* **Processing Delay**: Processing delay is the time it takes for a router or host to examine the packet's header, determine the output link, and check for errors.
    * Factors Influencing Processing Delay: 
        * Complexity of processing tasks at routers or hosts determines this delay
        * Faster processing rates reduce this delay.
    * Processing Delay Formula: dProc = Packet Length / Processing Rate
* **End-to-End Delay**: an accumulation of the nodal delays
    * End-to-End Delay Formula: dEnd-to-End = Q(dProc + dQueue + dTrans + dProp)
    * Minimizing end-to-end delays is critical for efficient and responsive computer networks and communication systems

**Packet Loss**
* If a packet arrives at a queue with a finite capacity that is already full or at its maximum capacity, the incoming packet is dropped or lost.

**Throughput**
* Throughput: the rate (bits/sec) at which bits are actually being transferred between a sender and a receiver in a network
* Instantaneous throughput: the rate of data transfer at a specific point in time
* Average throughput: the average rate of data transfer over a more extended period
* Throughput is often constrained by the slowest component in the communication path, known as the bottleneck.
