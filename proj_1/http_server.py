'''
Name: The worldâ€™s simplest HTTP server 
Goal: 
    Create an HTTP server using the python socket api. 
Description:
    Your program will create a listening socket bound to '127.0.0.1' or 'localhost', and a random port 
    number > 1023. You will then use your web browser to connect to your server and receive data. Note that
    your server could be running on any host within your LAN (as long as there's no firewall that can block
    access to it). 

Note:
    When your socket accepts a request, a new socket is created. Read the socket request on the new socket 
    and print it. Then send the following html data on the new socket and close it. 
        data =  "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n"\ 
                "Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\n\r\n"\ 
                "<html>Congratulations!  You've downloaded the first Wireshark lab file!</html>\r\n"
